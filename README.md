This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook: an infinite loop caused by a missing dependency. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, where the `useEffect` hook lacks the `count` dependency, leading to continuous re-renders.  The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, corrects the issue by including `count` in the dependency array, ensuring the effect only runs when the count changes.
